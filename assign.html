                    But alternative versions of the game existed much earlier and are a part of the football history.
                    The most admitted story tells that the game was developed in England in the 12th century. 
                    In this century games that resembled football were played on meadows and roads in England. Besides from kicks, 
                    the game involved also punches of the ball with the fist. 
                    This early form of football was also much more rough and more violent than the modern way of playing. </div>
